# odin-recipes
This is a project from The Odin Project to create a recipe website to practice basic html elements including:
Setting up html for use on documents (Declaring doctype, html, meta, etc)
Creating an index page for a website
Creating links to seperate pages where the recipes will be stored
Adding images

Notably, this project is purely html and as such will lack the formatting that comes from languages like css
